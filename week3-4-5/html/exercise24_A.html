        <h3>This weekend's special brunch</h3>
        <p>This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg on an English muffin. Not for the
            faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is
            that they are made with half cream and cooked in butter, with no more than four eggs in the pan at a time.
